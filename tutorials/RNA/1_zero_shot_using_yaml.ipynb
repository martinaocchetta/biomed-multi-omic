    "Assigning cell type annotations is an important and time consuming part of single-cell analysis using `biomed-multi-omic` for cell type annotation. BMFM-RNA simplifies this process by not only performing the cell-type annotation but also the preprocessing and visualisation through the embeddings created by the model."
